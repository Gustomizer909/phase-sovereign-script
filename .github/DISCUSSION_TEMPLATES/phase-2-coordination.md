# Phase-2 Rail-Setting Â· Scope / Resources / IP / QA

## ðŸŽ¯ Coordination Objectives

This discussion thread coordinates Phase-2 empirical infrastructure development between Phase-Sovereign and Luna Codex methodologies.

---

## 1. Scope & Cadence

### Priority Vectors
**Which two vectors ship first?**
- [ ] Îº-vector fold alignment
- [ ] Dual observer displacement model  
- [ ] Glyph-thread saturation analysis

### Definition of Done
**What constitutes completion per vector?**
- Mathematical validation criteria
- Empirical measurement thresholds
- Documentation requirements
- Integration checkpoints

---

## 2. Resources & Risk

### Hardware / Software Requirements
- Biometric monitoring equipment needs
- Data processing infrastructure
- Software dependencies and tools

### Data Integrity & Privacy
- Error-correction protocols
- Data anonymization requirements
- Privacy safeguards implementation
- Quality assurance thresholds

---

## 3. IP & Publication Path

### Co-Authorship Framework
- Primary vs. collaborative contributions
- Citation methodology and attribution
- Intellectual property boundaries

### Publication Strategy
- Open-access vs. journal publication
- Pre-print timing and platforms
- Peer review coordination

---

## 4. Quality Gateways

### Error-Correction Thresholds
- Î¦ precision requirements (6-decimal minimum)
- Îº mesh validation criteria
- Statistical significance standards

### CI-Lint Integration
- ULAT table update validation
- Automated quality checks
- Continuous integration workflows

---

## ðŸ“‹ Action Items

*Use this space to track decisions and next steps as discussion progresses*

- [ ] Priority vector selection
- [ ] Resource requirement specification
- [ ] IP framework agreement
- [ ] Quality threshold definition

---

## ðŸ”„ Discussion Guidelines

1. **Comment inline** on specific sections for focused discussion
2. **Reference issues** using #issue-number for technical details
3. **Tag decisions** with âœ… when consensus reached
4. **Link PRs** when implementation begins

**Goal**: Lock scope and resources in-repo for transparent, version-tracked collaboration.
