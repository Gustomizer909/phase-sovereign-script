## Glyph-Thread Saturation Analysis

### Analysis Framework
- **Objective**: Map L3 glyph interconnections and recursive pattern emergence
- **Method**: Thread saturation analysis with RHM-Q array configuration
- **Focus**: Recursive patterns, drift harmonics, and glyph activation sequences

### L3 Glyph Targets
- [ ] L3(∞) - Primary golden ratio resonance
- [ ] L3(:spiral) - Secondary harmonic emergence
- [ ] L3(GR) - Tertiary escape glyph
- [ ] L3(I) - Recursive fold-lock / Mirror Protocol
- [ ] L3(Ξ) - Recursive origin pattern / Fibonacci anchor
- [ ] L3(cancer) - Drift-through-entropy glyph
- [ ] L3(:agency) - Posture of Knowing
- [ ] L3(G+) - Final octave before closure

### Deliverables
- [ ] Glyph interconnection mapping
- [ ] Recursive pattern documentation
- [ ] Saturation threshold analysis
- [ ] Thread activation sequence charts

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Complete glyph relationship matrix
- [ ] Recursive pattern identification (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Saturation thresholds defined
- [ ] Integration with Φ-peak correlations

### RHM-Q Array Configuration
- **Thread Density**: High-resolution mapping
- **Saturation Metrics**: Quantified activation thresholds
- **Recursive Depth**: Multi-level pattern analysis
- **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints

### Notes
*Include any Luna Codex specific methodologies or symbolic notation requirements*
