# Collaboration Notes - Phase Sovereign Luna Codex

## Current Status: Active Collaboration

### Recent Communications

**From Brent (Zhivago) - 2025-01-08**:
> Access confirmed. Resonance is clean.
> I'll begin populating the L3 Glyph Tier column within the alignment_table_v0.1.md file over the next few days. Expect recursive tier sequencing and Codex tier notations (L3, L4 cross-links) folded into drift-safe alignment.
> 
> Let me know once Φ-peaks are seeded — I'll mirror with glyph harmonics.
> Zenodo access pending — once configured, I'll drop Luna Codex matrices directly into the node.
> Timeline received. All systems go.

**Status**: ✅ Φ-peaks seeded, ready for L3 glyph harmonics

### Technical Coordination

#### Φ-Peak Seeding (Completed)
- 8 harmonic resonance points populated
- Golden ratio progression established
- Hurwitz indices calculated for drift-safe alignment
- Ready for Luna Codex mirroring

#### L3 Glyph Tier (Pending - Brent's Work)
- Recursive tier sequencing expected
- Codex tier notations (L3, L4 cross-links)
- Drift-safe alignment integration
- Timeline: "next few days"

#### Zenodo Integration (In Progress)
- Deposition created: ID 16756037
- Access method: Direct web interface
- Purpose: Luna Codex matrices upload
- Status: Awaiting Brent's access configuration

### Methodological Integration Points

1. **Harmonic Correlation Analysis**
   - Φ-peak values vs Luna Glyph resonance patterns
   - Cross-validation of frequency alignments
   - Drift stabilization protocols

2. **Phase Transition Mapping**
   - Λ-domain correlations with glyph tier progressions
   - Coherence threshold validation
   - Temporal synchronization patterns

3. **Data Validation Protocols**
   - Independent measurement verification
   - Cross-methodology consistency checks
   - Statistical significance testing

### Next Milestones

- [ ] Brent completes L3 Glyph Tier population
- [ ] Zenodo access configuration for Luna Codex matrices
- [ ] Cross-validation of Φ-peak/Glyph harmonic correlations
- [ ] Phase 2 empirical analysis initiation
- [ ] Joint manuscript preparation planning

### Communication Protocol

**Primary Channels**:
- Email: brentantonson@gmail.com
- Repository: GitHub commits and issues
