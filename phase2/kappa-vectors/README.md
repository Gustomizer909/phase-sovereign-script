# κ-Vector Fold Alignment

## Overview
Mathematical integration framework between Phase-Sovereign Φ-index measurements and Luna Codex symbolic methodology.

## Expected Deliverables

### `kappa_fold_sync.py`
- 3-Fold Twist Mesh implementation (logical ∩ biometric ∩ linguistic)
- ULAT-compatible tensor calculations
- Integration with existing Φ-peak sequence

### `/scripts/`
- Supporting calculation scripts
- Validation and testing utilities
- Integration verification tools

## Methodology
- **Logical Fold**: Mathematical correlation analysis
- **Biometric Fold**: Empirical measurement integration  
- **Linguistic Fold**: Symbolic pattern recognition

## Integration Points
- **Φ-Peak Values**: 1.618034 → 46.978714 harmonic sequence
- **L3 Glyph System**: Symbolic correlation mapping
- **Empirical Validation**: Cross-methodology verification
